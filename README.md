1. title screen with Gravity dog jingle
1. Put a black rect behind the score so it does not get bugz mode.

1. Graphics: Going with png, not svg. (speed wins over scaling)
1. best score - NOT IMPLEMENTED

# Ideas
* Points are eggs, or waffles
* Characters are kitties, robots, or robo-kitties.
* cameos: Lego brick, Mario?, Sonic?

# Other simple game ideas:
* Pixel draw
* Escape!  (Sprite tries to get off-screen, you keep it on-screen)
