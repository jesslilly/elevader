elevader game

# TODO
1. Get POC working. See if it's fun.
1. Get good graphics. Going with png, not svg. (speed wins over scaling)
1. Intro screen
1. Scale to desktop, tablet size

# Ideas
* Points are eggs, or waffles
* Characters are kitties, robots, or robo-kitties.
* cameos: Lego brick, Mario?, Sonic?

# Other simple game ideas:
* Pixel draw
* Escape!  (Sprite tries to get off-screen, you keep it on-screen)
