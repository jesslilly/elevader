===========

Play [Gravity Dog](http://www.sparkyland.com/gravitydog) for free!  It's fun!

# TODO

##Future
1. Add an "add to home screen" link.
1. Facebook sharing
1. framework improvement: Better constructor for Prop/Sprite that takes an image name.
1. framework improvement: Add a sprite to a sprite instead of just to the animator.
5. sharper scaling.
5. Preload audio (Does not work on first intro screen on iPhone)
3. Mouse pointer should be a hand and not arrow in desktop mode.
5. scale canvas with no antialiasing instead of resizing canvas.
1. intro animation;  Space dog's spaceship blows up.

# Done
Review the github logs.

# Ideas
* One of the levels should have LOTS of dogs and puppies.  Puppies could have accessories.
* Points are eggs, or waffles
* Characters are kitties, robots, or robo-kitties.
* cameos: Lego brick, Mario?, Sonic?

# Other simple game ideas:
* Pixel draw
