Gravity Dog
===========

# TODO
1. touch indicator: make dog 90% smaller on touch begin. 100% on touch end. 
1. Buzz mode indicator. More legible at small size. 
2. Look into offline cache to play the game offline.
1. Add an "add to home screen" link.

# Done
1. See github logs for list of improvements.

# To Develop
* Clone the repo.  Open file:///C:/work/gravitydog/index.max.html in a browser.  Sometimes scripts have issues when you use file:// protocol.  If that happens, use a real (localhost) web server.
* There is a build step too.  I forget what that is!  LOL
