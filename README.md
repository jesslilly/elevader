2. Look into offline cache to play the game offline.
1. Add an "add to home screen" link.

# Done
1. See github logs for list of improvements.

# To Develop
* Use VS Code or other editor.
* Clone the github repo.  
* Open file:///C:/work/gravitydog/index.max.html in a browser.  Sometimes scripts have issues when you use file:// protocol.  If that happens, use a real (localhost) web server.
* Get npm
* Type npm install to get all the files in package.json.
* There is an index.js in case you want to run a web server with node on port 40001.  If you use that browse to http://localhost:40001/index.max.html.

# To Build
* Install gulp: npm install --global gulp-cli
* Type gulp.

# To Deploy
* To build the project run gulp!
* Copy the build files to jesslilly repo.  Commit and push them.
