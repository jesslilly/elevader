# TODO
1. Find tutorial/how to for iOS 7 mobile Adsense unit.

2. Progressively harder levels
1. Implement dual graphics system.  (Sprites.png for space dog and robot dog)
8. Make shortcut/bookmark.
9. Offline mode
1. framework improvement: Better constructor for Prop/Sprite that takes an image name.

# Done
10. Use gulp to build/minify

1. stars warp.  Also implemented checker in animator and update500 and check500 for performance.
4. NICE JOB! is not aligned well on mobile.
1. rename repo to gravitydog.
4. Hit test clickable rect instead of dog size.
1. Mode depends on the day with Monday being easiest!
3. Intro screen:  Add 重力 犬

2. Use one of these fonts: I love bitout, but silkscreen was so much easier to use.
1. Make replay button brighter than home button.
1. title screen with Gravity dog jingle
1. Put a black rect behind the score so it does not get bugz mode.
2. Put GD and URL icons on the canvas

1. Create Prop object for a sprite that does not move.
6. Add the earth.
1. Keep score
1. Bigger score.
1. Scale to desktop, tablet size
1. Graphics: Going with png, not svg. (speed wins over scaling)
1. best score - NOT IMPLEMENTED

# Ideas
* One of the levels should have LOTS of dogs and puppies.  Puppies could have accessories.
* Points are eggs, or waffles
* Characters are kitties, robots, or robo-kitties.
* cameos: Lego brick, Mario?, Sonic?

# Other simple game ideas:
* Pixel draw
* Escape!  (Sprite tries to get off-screen, you keep it on-screen)
