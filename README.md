Gravity Dog
===========

Play [Gravity Dog](http://www.sparkyland.com/gravitydog) for free!  It's fun!

# TODO
1. touch indicator
1. Alternate bugs mode at 100s. 
1. Full screen?
1. Buzz mode indicator. More legible at small size. 
2. Look into offline cache to play the game offline.

## Future
1. Add an "add to home screen" link.
1. Facebook sharing
1. framework improvement: Better constructor for Prop/Sprite that takes an image name.
1. framework improvement: Add a sprite to a sprite instead of just to the animator.
5. sharper scaling.
5. Preload audio (Does not work on first intro screen on iPhone)
3. Mouse pointer should be a hand and not arrow in desktop mode.
5. scale canvas with no antialiasing instead of resizing canvas.
1. intro animation;  Space dog's spaceship blows up.

# Done
1. See github logs for list of improvements.

# Ideas
* One of the levels should have LOTS of dogs and puppies.  Puppies could have accessories.
* Points are eggs, or waffles
* Characters are kitties, robots, or robo-kitties.

# To Develop
* Clone the repo.  Open file:///C:/work/gravitydog/index.max.html in a browser.  Sometimes scripts have issues when you use file:// protocol.  If that happens, use a real (localhost) web server.
* There is a build step too.  I forget what that is!  LOL
